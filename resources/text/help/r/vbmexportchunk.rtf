<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Preprocessor that exports a TRSE image file (.flf) to binary on build in a format suitable for the
    Vic Bitmap Mode (VBM). This version of the command takes a starting character from an FLF character
    editor file and allows you to extract the data in a height and width chunk.</p>
<p>
    VBM export takes six parameters.  
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The source flf file</li>
    <li>The destination bin file to create</li>
    <li>The start character</li>
    <li>The width in characters</li>
    <li>The height in characters</li>
    <li>Hires (0) or multicolour (1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Characters are exported rows first, then columns. So a width of 2 and a height of 2 starting at character 0 would export a binary
    file with characters 0, 40, 1, 41.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
The follow example will export 25 characters, starting at character 120, with a width and height of 5 and in hires mode
from the .flf charset file to a binary file.
<code>
program VBMExportChunk;

@vbmexportchunk "sprite/mySprite.flf" "sprite/mySprite.bin" 120 5 5 0
var
    mySprite : incbin("sprite/mySprite.bin",$2000);

begin
    Loop();
end.
</code>
