<h3>Volatile</h3>
Note: Volatile is only implemented on the 6502, and is currently experimental.
Define a volatile byte/integer:
<code>
var
   b : byte volatile at $300;

</code>
Reading / writing to this variable will not be optimised away, ie the optimiser will not remove the second line
in the following expression:
<code>
b:=10;
b:=10;
</code>
Volatile is useful for computers that require multiple reads/writes from specific hardware registers (such aas the SNES, NES)
