C64; Ray Tracer Demo Effects; C64/DemoEffects_raytracer/; <h2>The built-in "Fjong" real-time ray tracer for C64 demo effects</h2><br><img src=":resources/images/tutorials/fjong1.png" width="260"><p>The built-in "Fjong" Raytracer enables creation of ray-traced 3D scenes that can be exported to a data format that the C64/Amiga/VIC-20 etc can read. Most of the demos effects created with TRSE used this ray tracer. <p>You program your scenes in Lua, and then run the Fjong 3D program with CTRL+R. In this project, a number of C64 examples have been supplied in order to demonstrate the synergy between the Fjong ray tracer and the TRSE compiler. <p>The lua script language in TRSE has been expanded with a bunch of useful commands for compressing and exporting user-defined 8-bit data.
