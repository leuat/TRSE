 * ![toc]
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * This header provides the public API for the core of the CHIP-8 toolkit.
 *
 * The core of the CHIP-8 interpreter is written to be platform independent.
 * To use this core, one needs to use this API to create
 * a platform-specific _implementation_. This _implementation_ should do the
 * following:
 *
 * * Step through the instructions in the interpreter; see `c8_step()`.
 * * Draw the graphics; The resolution is obtained through `c8_resolution()`
 *     and then the individual pixel states are read through `c8_get_pixel()`
 * * Tell the interpreter about the state of the keyboard; It should call
 *     `c8_key_down()` and `c8_key_up()` when the state of the keyboard
 *     changes.
 * * Tell the intepreter about every 60Hz timer tick; see `c8_60hz_tick()`.
 * * Play sound. Since the sound is just a buzzer, you may wish to skip this;
 *     See `c8_sound()`.
 *
 * The header also includes an API for the CHIP-8 assembler and a disassembler.
 * The syntax is based on **Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference v1.0**
 * by Thomas P. Greene available at
 * <http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM>
